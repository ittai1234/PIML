# Physics Informed Machine Learning Project

## Introduction
Hi, this project incorporates physical concepts in machine learning to enhance the performance of the machine, thereby achieving better accuracy and efficiency. We explore classic linear and nonlinear systems including Pendulums, Lorenz Attractors, Double Pendulums, and Water Movement.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Predict future accelerations or positions of the systems as they evolve over time.
- Derive the equations of motion for these systems.

## Methods
We will achieve our objectives using a blend of traditional and cutting-edge machine learning techniques:
- **Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)**: For discovering governing equations directly from data.
- **Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN)**: Including Lagrangian Neural Networks and simpler architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks.
- **Neural Operators**: Specifically, Fourier Neural Operators for continuous learning.
- **Neural Network-Based PDE Solving Algorithms**: To solve partial differential equations.
- **Autoencoder Architectures**: For complex dataset feature extraction and reduction.
