Hi, this is a project about physics informed machine learning.
In the project I incorporate physical concepts in machine learning to enhance the performace of the machine in order to get better performance.
The project will include classic linear and nonlinear systems such as a Pendulum and a Lorenz Attractor, Double Pendulum, Water movment.
