Hi, this is a project about physics informed machine learning.
In the project I incorporate physical concepts in machine learning to enhance the performace of the machine in order to get better performance.
The project will include classic linear and nonlinear systems such as a Pendulum and a Lorenz Attractor, Double Pendulum, Water movment.
The goal of the project is to be able to predict the future accelerations or the future positions of the systems which change in time and or to get the equations of motion of the systems via Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics(SINDy) and Physics Informed Neural Networks(PINN) such as Lagrangian Neural Networks or even networks of simpler architecture such as Recurrent Neural Network.
